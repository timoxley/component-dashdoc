<h1>addressit</h1>

<p>AddressIt is a freeform street address parser, that is designed to take a piece of text and convert that into a structured address that can be processed in different systems.</p>

<p>The focal point of <code>addressit</code> is on the street parsing component, rather than attempting to appropriately identify various states, counties, towns, etc, as these vary from country to country fairly dramatically.  These details are instead put into a generic regions array that can be further parsed based on your application needs.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<p>The following is a simple example of how address it can be used:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="js">// parse a made up address, with some slightly tricky parts
var address = addressit('Shop 8, 431 St Kilda Rd Melbourne');
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>address</code> object would now contain the following information:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="">{ text: '8/431 ST KILDA RD MELBOURNE',
  parts: [],
  unit: 8,
  country: undefined,
  number: 431,
  street: 'ST KILDA RD',
  regions: [ 'MELBOURNE' ] }
</pre></div>

<p>For more examples, see the tests.</p>

<h2>Built for Node and the Browser</h2>

<p>The addressit module is designed to work both in the browser and in node.  If you do wish to use it in a node environment, simply install the package into your project:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="">npm install addressit
</pre></div>

<p>For the browser, simply download either <a href="/DamonOehlman/addressit/master/addressit.js">addressit.js</a> or <a href="/DamonOehlman/addressit/master/addressit.min.js">addressit.min.js</a> and include it in your page.</p>
