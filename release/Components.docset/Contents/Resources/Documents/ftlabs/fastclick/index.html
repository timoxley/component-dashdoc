<h1>FastClick</h1>

<p>FastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the firing of a <code>click</code> event on mobile browsers. The aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while avoiding any interference with your current logic.</p>

<p>FastClick is developed by <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a>, part of the Financial Times.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>The library has been deployed as part of the <a href="http://app.ft.com/">FT Web App</a> and is tried and tested on the following mobile browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mobile Safari on iOS 3 and upwards</li>
<li>Chrome on iOS 5 and upwards</li>
<li>Chrome on Android (ICS)</li>
<li>Opera Mobile 11.5 and upwards</li>
<li>Android Browser since Honeycomb</li>
<li>PlayBook OS 1 and upwards</li>
</ul>

<p>FastClick doesn't attach any listeners on desktop browsers as it is not needed. Those that have been tested are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Opera</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Include fastclick.js in your JavaScript bundle or add it to your HTML page like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="html">
<script type='application/javascript' src='/path/to/fastclick.js'></script>

</pre></div>

<p>The script must be loaded prior to instantiating FastClick on any element of the page.</p>

<p>To instantiate FastClick on the <code>body</code>, which is the recommended method of use:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="js">window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    new FastClick(document.body);
}, false);
</pre></div>

<h3>Google Closure Compiler</h3>

<p>FastClick supports compilation with <code>ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS</code> ('advanced mode'), which should reduce its size by about 70% (60% gzipped). Note that exposure of the <code>FastClick</code> variable isn't forced therefore you must compile it along with all of your code.</p>

<h3>AMD</h3>

<p>FastClick has AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) support. This allows it to be lazy-loaded with an AMD loader, such as <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>.</p>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>Internally, FastClick uses <code>document.createEvent</code> to fire a synthetic <code>click</code> event as soon as <code>touchend</code> is fired by the browser. It then suppresses the additional <code>click</code> event created by the browser after that. In some cases, the non-synthetic <code>click</code> event created by the browser is required, as described in the <a href="http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html">triggering focus example</a>.</p>

<p>This is where the <code>needsclick</code> class comes in. Add the class to any element that requires a non-synthetic click.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>FastClick is designed to cope with many different browser oddities. Here are some examples to illustrate this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/layer.html">basic use</a> showing the increase in perceived responsiveness</li>
<li><a href="http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html">triggering focus</a> on an input element from a <code>click</code> handler</li>
<li><a href="http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/input.html">input element</a> which never receives clicks but gets fast focus</li>
</ul>
