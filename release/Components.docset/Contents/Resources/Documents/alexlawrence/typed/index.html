<h1>typed</h1>

<p>Static typing library for JavaScript. Works in Node.js and in most browsers.<br />Official page and live examples: <a href='http://alexlawrence.github.com/typed'>http://alexlawrence.github.com/typed</a></p>

<h2>Static typing at runtime</h2>

<p>typed provides static typing for function arguments at runtime without any compilation steps.<br />It works with native types (Boolean, Number, String, etc.), global available custom types and so called structures <br />(similar to interfaces, named after destructuring).<br />Just add type declaration comments to your arguments and wrap your functions inside the <strong>typed()</strong> function.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="javascript">var Greeter = typed(function(greeting /*:String*/) {
  this.greeting = greeting;
});

Greeter.prototype.greet = function() {
  return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
};

var greeter = new Greeter("world");

console.log(greeter.greet());
</pre></div>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>typed consists of two parts: argument type parsing and runtime argument type checking. The built-in parsers (comment, suffix and no parser) search the source code of the passed functions for type declarations. By default the <strong>comment parser</strong> is used. Unfortunately some JavaScript environments like Firefox and IE7 do not provide the original code comments when reading a function's source code. However this does not result in any error. typed simply won't perform any type checking in un.</p>

<h2>Alternative formats</h2>

<p>If the argument comments donÂ´t work for you can also use the <strong>suffix parser</strong> which searches in argument names for type suffixes. Another option is to use no parser and to provide the type information manually by populating the <strong>types</strong> array of a typed function. Look at the advanced examples to see the usage of these formats.</p>

<h2>Performance and production environments</h2>

<p>Since the type parsing and type checking is performed at runtime your code will obviously run a bit slower compared to not using typed. Alternatively, you can perform type checking only during development and turn typed off for production environments by setting <strong>typed.active</strong> to false. When deactivated typed will not decorate any passed in functions.</p>
